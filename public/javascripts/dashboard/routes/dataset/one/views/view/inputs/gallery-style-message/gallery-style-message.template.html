        Your gallery can have different styles. The <strong>Image Gallery</strong> is the default, and will display either text only or images specified in your data source. The <strong>Icon Gallery</strong> will let you choose images to represent specific categories of data that repeat for each tile, for example images for Male and Female. Finally, the <strong>Heatmap Gallery</strong> lets you display tiles with color backgrounds, mapped to fields in your data. Color mappings are defined in General Settings.
